## What Is Rentilly?

Rentilly is a community marketplace based app that allows users to post, buy, rent, and sell items for everyone in your local area. 

## How Does It Work?

1. Go to https://final-project-jamt.herokuapp.com/.
2. Hit the sign up button to create your own account by adding your email and password.
3. Once you've created your account you can login with your email and password.
4. On your home page you will find four options: My Items For Rent, My Items For Sale, My Messages, My Requests.
	4a. In My Items For Rent you can view all of your personal items that are available for users to rent out at any time. 	4b. In My Items For Sale you can view all of your personal items you are ready to part with. Post an image for the item, set a sale cost, with a full detailed description of the item. 
	4c. In My Messages you can view your correspondence with users who are renting or selling items. You can discuss the details of each item of interest and even negotiate a price point.
	4d. In My Requests you can view a history of all the items a user has either purchased or rented for record keeping purposes. 
5. The tabs near the header of the app allow a user to Post an Item, Rent an Item, Buy an Item, or view the most recent Item Requests. 5a. In Post and Item a user can post an image of your item for rent/sale, set a cost per hour or total sale, and put in a description of your item. 5b. In Rent an Item a user can view/search all possible items available for rent, read a full description of the item, and even message the owner for further details about the item. 5c. In Buy an Item a user can view/search all possible items available for sale, read a full description of the item, and even message the owner for further details about the item. 5d.
